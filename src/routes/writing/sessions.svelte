  <pre>Thoughts and feelings,
Overwhelming. passions and
Truths. multiple and deafening.</pre>

  <pre>To be under five needles. six voices. nine spirits.
One journey. one story. one movement.
Together.</pre>

  <pre>Threading ink through skin.
Open hearts,
Touched. connected. joined. mended.</pre>

  <pre>Time of inspiration.
Of discovery.
Time of friendship.</pre>
