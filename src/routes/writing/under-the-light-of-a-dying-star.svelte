    Under the light of a dying star, Aaron McBarnes sits in front of his
    television. The show he’s watching is hilarious, sending him into fits of
    laughter, reminding him of his grandmother. They would sit together most
    evening, in this very room, watching reruns of old serials from her youth,
    as she commented on the unfolding events with her sharp tongued wit, making
    him giggle. He remembers the day he became a doctor, a dream he’d had ever
    since he watched her die in that hospital, unable to do anything but stand
    by and watch her chest rise and fall, pumped by the machine sitting next to
    him, by her bed. Grief is a strange emotion. It arrives with an intensity
    that dulls and fades, but can return at the slightest trigger, stabbing into
    your heart and stomach, making you relive it all over again. He misses her.

    In the house next door, Linda Hunt and Dennis Ford sit together in silence
    as they eat their dinner. Neither of them is happy with their marriage.
    Linda remembers that first unforgettable kiss, under the red light of the
    setting sun. Dennis had taken her to the modern art museum that day, and
    told her all about the methods and motivations of the various artists. She
    didn’t follow everything, but she loved to hear him speak with such passion.
    She remembers the day their daughter was born, the sight of her screaming
    face, and joy she felt to hold her close. But now, as she sits in silence,
    picking at the greens on her plate, she thinks about the boredom, stagnant
    life she now lives. “This relationship isn’t working,” she thinks. “This
    isn’t why I got married.”

    Dennis, watched his wife move the leaves around her plate, lost in thought.
    Watching her hands move around the plate, he remembers the soft hands of his
    first love caressing his face. She had held him as they lay on his bed,
    gazing into his eyes, moving her finger ever so slightly against his cheek.
    It has been years since he’d felt that feeling of connection and care. Being
    honest with himself, he has been pretty low these past few years. “I regret
    getting married,” he thinks, scratching his forehead, before rising from his
    seat, taking his empty plate into the kitchen without comment. Perhaps he
    could lose himself in that old dog-eared copy of his favourite book that he
    could never quite let go of. That had helped in the past.

    On the other side of the city, in the house known by the neighbourhood kids
    as the “creepy green house”, Alan Ford and Charles Johnson laze about in
    bed, reminiscing about their childhoods. Charles talks about flying a kite
    with his cousin, under the red light of the dying star, feeling the tug of
    the string and the firmness of the older boy’s guiding hands. Then he
    remembers what came next. “I won’t make the same mistake twice,” he thinks
    as he listens to Alan talk about the party that shaped his life.

    Meanwhile, downstairs in the study, beneath an old painting of a rancid
    magician dancing with an evil-looking mirror in a castle inherited with the
    strange old house, Jose Hernandez sits in front of his computer, waiting for
    Grindows to boot. He had already given up on watching television on the old
    black and white set in the living room, and has decided to update his
    existentialist blog instead. While he waits he falls into the memory of the
    trip that first inspired him to start it. He remembers sitting beneath the
    stars in the mountains, alone but for the wind. He had looked out into that
    endless sky and wondered what existed out there. Were any of those faint
    dots worlds like this one, inhabited by thinking feeling creatures? Do they
    too grow old and die? Do they believe in an afterlife? “What will happen
    when I die?” he thinks, as the computer makes the familiar rising sound of
    the boot completing. “Oh, that’s going on my blog.”
