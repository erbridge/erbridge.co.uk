  <p>
    This game requires an audience. Two players share an Xbox controller,
    holding one side each behind their backs. They should stand so they are
    unable to see the screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The audience should be able to see the screen and be heard by the players
    (but turn the volume up loud).
  </p>

  <p>
    Each player controls one of the coloured circles on the screen. They both
    have metal detectors that work in different ways. One of them has a long
    range detector that vibrates when they are moving in the direction of the
    treasure, but gets weaker as it gets closer. The other has a short range
    detector that gets stronger, the closer it gets to the treasure. When both
    players are standing on the treasure, they win.
  </p>

  <p>
    The audience's job is to guide the two players, to help them find the
    treasure and each other without stepping on any mines.
  </p>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
